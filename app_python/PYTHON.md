# Best Practices in the Python Web Application

## Framework Selection

Flask was used for this project due to its lightweight nature and ease of setup for simple applications like displaying the current time. Flask's simplicity makes it ideal for rapid development, and it has robust support for extensions if needed in the future.

## Implementation

The app will use Python's datetime module in combination with the pytz library to ensure accurate timezone conversion for Moscow.

## Testing

The app was tested manually to confirm the time updates when the page refreshes.

## Coding standards

PEP 8 was followed as coding standards. Proper naming convention was used.

## Code quality

The program structure is divided into multiple functions for maintainability.
