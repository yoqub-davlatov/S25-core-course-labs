# Terraform

## Best practices applied

- variables.tf is used to manage variables.
- .gitignore is used to avoid adding unnecessary files to git

## Nginx

Directory: learn-terraform-docker-container

- `terraform show`

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

- terraform plan -out deploy.tfplan

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes
are needed.
