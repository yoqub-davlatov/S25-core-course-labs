# Best Practices in the Go Web Application

## Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: The `go.mod` file ensures dependency management and project modularity.
- **Built-in Packages**: Uses Go's standard library for lightweight and efficient functionality.
- **JSON Responses**: Consistent and structured responses with proper `Content-Type` headers.
- **Default Handling**: Defaults to "Guest" when no name is provided, improving user experience.
- **Clear Separation**: Encapsulated logic in the handler function for simplicity and maintainability.

## Coding Standards

- **Go Conventions**: Clear, concise names and adherence to Go's idiomatic style.
- **Structs for JSON**: Ensures type safety and consistent response structures.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully in tests and defaults.

## Testing and Quality

- **Unit Testing**: Uses `httptest` for testing handlers without requiring an active server.
- **JSON Validation**: Tests decode JSON into structs to verify response structure.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoids unnecessary libraries, adhering to Go's simplicity.

These practices ensure a clean, maintainable, and robust application ready for future improvements.
